## Prerequisites

- NGINX Prometheus Exporter binary. See the [main README](../../README.md) for installation instructions.
- NGINX or NGINX Plus running on the same machine.

## Running NGINX Prometheus Exporter with Web Configuration in Basic Authentication mode

You can run NGINX Prometheus Exporter with web configuration in Basic Authentication mode using the following command:

```console
nginx-prometheus-exporter --web.config.file=web-config.yml --nginx.scrape-uri="http://127.0.0.1:8080/stub_status"
```

Depending on your environment, you may need to specify the full path to the binary or change the path to the web
configuration file.

## Verification

Run `curl -u alice:password http://localhost:9113/metrics` to see the metrics exposed by the exporter. Without the `-u`
flag, the request will fail with `401 Unauthorized`.
